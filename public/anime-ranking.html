<h1>Top 5 Favourite Animes of Aishik Ray</h1>

<h2>There are a lot of Animes out there and out of the ones that I watched over the years, these are my top 5 favourite ones</h2>

<hr />

<h3>1. Naruto: Shippuden</h3>
<p>The reason I put this anime as No. 1 in this list is because it has one of the greatest storylines in anime history and I just really liked the anime as a whole which shows how Naruto grew as a person and how it impacted the lives of the people around him.</p>

<h3>2. Attack on Titan</h3>
<p>This is actually the second anime that I watched and although the starting few episodes felt really boring, it soon took my interest as the storyline progressed to what can be called one of the best, if not the best plot twist in the entire anime history. Epic Anime</p>

<h3>3. Vinland Saga</h3>
<p>This Anime is a work of Art. The animation one of the best ever and the storyline is even better! Truly one of the greatest anime as it changed my entire perspective of life and helped me overcome a lot of challenges in real life.</p>

<h3>4. Your Name</h3>
<p>This is the first ever anime movie that I watched and I absolutely loved it! The animation, the story, the characters, everything was top-notch and overall one of the best romance animeout there in my opinion.</p>

<h3>5. Kaguya-Sama: Love is War</h3>
<p>This is another rom-com anime and the reason it's one of my top 5 animes of all time, is because of its fluidity of the story and the characters, how they interact with each other from being literal rivals to being on the same page on most of the topics, I absolutelyloved it!</p>
